Hi, I'm Sam and I am looking to become a data analyst.
I studied Environmental Data Science in college with most of my projects being done in R.
More recently, I have completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate where I worked on my analysis skills using Excel, Python, and SQL.
As I continue to develop my skills as a data analyst, you can find all my projects here.
